# Don't be lazy, make sure you read the credits and license. Thanks!
Don’t be lazy. Follow all the steps, or you’ll end up in a loop of frustration and stupidity. READ the credits and license before you embarrass yourself. Thanks!
This version is more detailed, assertive, and comes with a generous amount of "motivation" for those who might be tempted to skim over important steps.

## Credits

Pay attention here because **this is the part you must read**. These contributors did way more work than you:
- [winsnip (GitHub)](https://github.com/winsnip) | [Telegram](https://t.me/winsnip)

And if you even think about skipping the **README** and **LICENSE**, you better start looking for a new career. It’s all in the folder. **READ IT.**

# Abracadabra Bot

This bot project allows you to interact with Telegram bots, manage sessions, and retrieve WebView data for all your accounts. **Now, before you even think about skipping anything, stop being lazy and read through this carefully!** Trust me, you’ll thank me later—especially if you’re one of those sellers who never reads documentation and keeps asking dumb questions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository. Yes, that means **use Git** like a normal human:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/naufalprtm/abracadabra.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory. It's not that hard:
    ```bash
    cd abracadabra
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies. Again, **don’t be lazy**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

1. Set up your `.env` file **properly** (yeah, I’m talking to you who never bothers to follow instructions):
    - Rename `example.env` to `.env`—it’s literally just renaming a file.
    - Put in your **actual** API credentials. If you don’t know where to find them, **Google it** like everyone else:
      ```env
      # For Major Bot
      TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
      AUTHORIZED_USERS=your_telegram_id
      API_ID=your_api_telegram
      API_HASH=your_api_hash_telegram
      ```

2. To get your `API_ID` and `API_HASH`, you need to visit [**my.telegram.org/auth**](https://my.telegram.org/auth). Log in with your Telegram account and follow the instructions to generate these keys. **Yes, you actually have to do this** if you want the bot to work. No shortcuts here, buddy.

3. Optional, but let’s be honest, you probably need it: Set up a proxy. 
   - Make a `proxy.txt` file, **don’t whine if you can’t find the path**. Manually set it if needed.

## Usage

1. Now you can **finally** run the bot, but don’t mess this up:
    ```bash
    node KAMU-DIAM.js
    ```

2. Follow the instructions on the screen like a **normal, functioning** person:
    - **Option 1:** Login with your phone number (no, your brain isn’t enough, it needs a phone number). If you’ve done this already, **don’t be an idiot** and skip to the next step.
    - **Option 2:** Login with a session file if you actually know what that means. Otherwise, skip this too.
    - **Option 3:** Request WebView for all accounts. Yes, **all of them**. If you think you can’t handle it, maybe reconsider your life choices.
    - **Option 5:** Refresh the Query ID for a selected bot. If you let it expire, you deserve this.

## Bot List

Here are the **approved** bots for you to use. **Don’t be clever** and try others unless you like wasting time:
- `@notpixel`
- `@blumCryptobot`
- `@Binance_Moonbix_bot`
- `@TsubasaRivalsBot`
- `@catsgang_bot`
- `@theFreeDogs_bot`
- `@BabyDogePAWS_Bot`
- `@NomisAppBot`
- `@fintopio`
- `@major`

You can also find the list in the `bot_list.txt` file, because **some people need everything spoon-fed**.

## Referral URL

- If you’re into referral schemes, update `url.txt` with your referral links. If you're **too lazy to set it up?**, then just ignore it. 

## Final Execution

Alright, once you’ve done **everything** above (no skipping!), here’s your last command to run:
```
       chmod +x SilakanPaduka.sh
       ./SilakanPaduka.sh
```
Bad interpreter?
```
       dos2unix SilakanPaduka.sh
```
## For screen usage: To detach from the running bot, use Ctrl + A, D not Ctrl + C; that will just terminate the bot, and we don’t want that!
